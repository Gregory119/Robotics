  - $ git clone https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits.git
  - $ cd PiBits/ServoBlaster/user/

  - edit Makefile line which has "gcc -Wall -g -O2 -o servod servod.c mailbox.c -lm" to:
  arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -Wall -g -O2 --sysroot=/rasppi_xcompile/sysroot -I./include -I/usr/local/include -o servod servod.c mailbox.c -lm
  - copy the servod binary to /usr/local/bin on the mounted image directory or pi
  - copy the servo blaster bash script to /usr/startscripts
  - give the file permissions
    - chmod 755 start_servoblaster.sh
  
  The following steps are necessary if no other script has been configured to start the servo blaster binary (servod)
  - copy the servo blaster service file to /lib/systemd/system/ on the mounted image or pi
  - once booted
