instructions made while compiling boost v1.64.0

Cross compile and install:
  - setup cross compile environment
  - downloads can be found at http://www.boost.org/users/download/
  - extract files
  - configure the cross compile, build, and install (ensure that the PATH variable includes the directory to the arm tools)
    - you can read more details at http://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/tasks/crosscompile.html and http://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/installation.html
    - find and copy user-config.jam to your /root directory (build commands as super user - login with su first)
    - add the following to user-config.jam:
      	  # Configure gcc for arm
	  using gcc : arm : arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ ;
    - ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/home/rasppi_xcompile/extra_libs_install/boost
    - the prefix is used as the install directory
    - ./b2 install toolset=gcc-arm
