Definitions:
  Index - holds staged files by adding them from the working directory.
  Head - holds the commits of the staged files

- Change the last commit message, assuming it has not been pushed.

  $ git commit --amend -m "New message"
  or
  $ git commit --amend
  will open a text editor with the previous message to be edited.

- You have committed additional files by mistake in the last commit.
  The last commit can be undone, reverting the head and index,
  but not touching the working directory, with the following command:

  $ git reset <commit>
  <commit> commit hash for the Head to reset to.
