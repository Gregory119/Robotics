%%%%%% INSTRUCTIONS %%%%%%
The first instructions are for the new systemd method.
The instructions after that are for the older method.

==wifi==
- edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
- ensure that the contents of the file is as follows:
  country=GB
  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  update_config=1

  network={
           ssid="HUAWEI-E5330-469A"
           psk="fta43ea9"
  }

==ethernet==
static ip for direct ethernet connection between laptop and pi [1]
- edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf
- at the end of the file add:
  interface eth0
  static ip_address=192.168.1.164/22 
- 22 in the last line corresponds to the mask 255.255.252.0
- set the laptop ethernet to the same mask and a different ip to connect

%%%%%% FOLLOWING METHODS ARE FOR NON-SYSTEMD (OLD) %%%%%%
%%%%%% SETTING UP PI WIFI IN PMB %%%%%%
- connect the pi to the router via ethernet
- find the pi IP address by logging into the router
- ssh to the pi (user=pi, password=raspberry)
- check that the wifi drivers are installed and the usb wifi dongle recognised on the pi
- edit the network settings by opening the interface file:
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

- overwrite the information with the following:
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.164
netmask 255.255.252.0
gateway 192.168.1.1

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
address 192.168.1.174	
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1

- set the configuration settings by opening wpa_supplicant.conf:
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

- overwrite the information with the following:
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
update_config=1

network={
ssid="wifi ID"
psk="wifi key"
proto=WPA
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
pairwise=TKIP
group=TKIP
id_str="wifi ID"
}

- restart the network service with the command: 
	sudo service networking reload
- OR turn off the pi and disconnect power and ethernet cable. Wait for at least 10 seconds before turning it back on and trying to ping the pi.

%%%%% SETTING UP PI WIFI WITH TELKOM DONGLE %%%%%% 
- change the settings in the /etc/network/interface file to the following:

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.164
netmask 255.255.252.0
#gateway removed to aloow internet through wifi

allow-hotplug wlan0
auto wlan0

iface wlan0 inet dhcp
	wpa-ssid "HUAWEI-E5330-469A"
	wpa-psk "fta43ea9"

- restart the network service with the command: 
	sudo service networking reload
- check assigned ip address with ifconfig => wifi connection
