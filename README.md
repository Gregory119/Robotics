This code is used for the camera based robot that I have created.


!!TO DO:
phase 1:
- replace steering part
- field test as radio control car

phase 2:
- add more checks for controlling the gopro with simultaneous commands (eg. start vid then try take pic)
- add gopro api into bushbot project and test
- mod gopro mount to hold nut and buy nut
- field test with gopro and live stream

phase 3:
- improve wheel fastening by ensuring enough available thread for lock nut
- improve steering range of motion
- decrease wheel rotational play
- improve wheel alignment on shafts
- use batteries for the base station
- base station housing with screen

phase 4:
- prototype test of gimbal electronics and firmware
- mechanical design, construction, and testing of gimbal for gopro initially, but keep in mind DSLRs

phase 5:
- software integration of gimbal

phase 6:
- incorporate trigger for DSLR
- incorporate DSLR in gimbal
