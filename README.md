# Robotics
This code is used for the camera based robot that I have created.


!!TO DO:
phase 1:
- replace steering part
- add watchdog message for radio control (from base-station to robot)
- field test as radio control car

phase 2:
- add more checks for controlling the gopro with simultaneous commands (eg. start vid then try take pic)
- add gopro api into bushbot project and test
- mod gopro mount to hold nut and buy nut
- field test with gopro and live stream

- update startscripts on robot and basestation and test
  (start_bushbot.sh and start_servoblaster.sh)
  uninstall the previous startscript setup for servoblaster
