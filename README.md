This code is used for the camera based robot that I have created.


!!TO DO:
phase 2:
- mod software to allow non-linear steering mechanism
- modify steering parts to accommodate wheel vertical motion
- field test with gopro and live stream

phase 3:
- use AA batteries for the base station
- base station housing with screen

phase 4:
- prototype test of gimbal electronics and firmware
- mechanical design, construction, and testing of gimbal for gopro initially, but keep in mind DSLRs

phase 5:
- software integration of gimbal

phase 6:
- incorporate trigger for DSLR
- incorporate DSLR in gimbal
