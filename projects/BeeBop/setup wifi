- ssh to the pi (user=pi, password=raspberry)
- check that the wifi drivers are installed and the usb wifi dongle recognised on the pi
- edit the network settings by opening the interface file:
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

- overwrite the information with the following:
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.1.164
netmask 255.255.252.0
gateway 192.168.1.1

auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
address 192.168.1.174	
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
update_config=1

network={
ssid="wifi ID"
psk="wifi key"
