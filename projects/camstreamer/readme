Introduction
=================================================
/* EDIT THIS FOR THE CAMSTREAMER PROJECT */

Bushbot is a wildlife based photography robot.
Raspberry pis are used for the robot and for a
ground station. A single sd card image needs to be created,
which is then slightly modified to be used as either
the robot or base station. This document describes 
the process of creating these sd card images.

=================================================
Requirements
=================================================
- Raspberry Pi B+ (with power source)
- 8 GB sd card
- network connection to the pi (eg. wifi, ethernet) 
for ssh control from another computer, or connect
the pi to an HDMI tv and connect a keyboard and 
mouse to the pi.

=================================================
Installing Raspbian on the SD Card
=================================================
- download the raspbian lite image and load it onto the 8 GB sd card
- setup wifi by following: - https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/83502916-how-to-setup-wifi-on-raspbian-jessie-lite
- create root password
 - $ sudo passwd
 - follow instructions

=================================================
Install Pre-requisite Software Packages on the 
SD card
=================================================
- update
 - $ apt-get update
- install ssh
 - $ apt-get install openssh-server
- install github
 - $ apt-get install git
- install xboxdrv driver for the xbox controller (NOT NEEDED ANYMORE)
 - $ apt-get install xboxdrv
- install wiringPi
 - $ apt-get install wiringPi
 - or use the files in Robotics/arm_pkgs if there are any problems experienced with compiling/runtime
- compile and install servoblaster
 - $ cd /
 - $ git clone https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits.git
 - $ cd PiBits/ServoBlaster/user/
 - $ make
 - the following command will install the driver so that it can be called from any directory. It also sets up a start script to start it from power up of the pi.
 - $ make install
 - change the start script such that the driver continuously provides a pulse signal:
  - open up the start script /etc/init.d/servoblaster and change the line "OPTS="--idle-timeout=2000"" to "OPTS="""

=================================================
Project Compilation
=================================================
- download repository
 - $ cd /
 - $ git clone https://github.com/Gregory119/Robotics.git
 - $ cd Robotics
- switch to branch if necessary (this step will not be necessary after first version is made)
 - $ git checkout <branch>
- build the bushbot project software
 - $ cd projects/bushbot
 - $ make

=================================================
Start Scipts
=================================================
- set up the start up script as described in ./scripts/readme
=================================================
Serial Port Configuration
=================================================
Disable the OS from using the serial port as a login interface:
- $ sudo raspi-config
- select "Advanced Options"
- select "Serial"
- select "No"
- select "Ok"
- select "finish" and then reboot
This process has been known to disable the serial port. To enable it for external device use:
- open the file /boot/config.txt
- change "enable_uart=0" to "enable_uart=1"
